  <h1>Wing - <span>手羽中</span></h1>
  <p>
    Wing flats are my favorite when having buffalo wings and they are also great as yakitori. The
    flat is splayed out to allow it to cook faster and crisp the skin up. Right towards the end of
    grilling the wing is dipped in tare. The bones are kept in, so make sure to get all the good
    bits off.
