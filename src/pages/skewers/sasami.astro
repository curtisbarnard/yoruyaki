  <h1>Tender - <span>ささみ</span></h1>
  <p>
    Located under the breast and along the rib cage this cut of white meat needs to be treated
    delicately. It is marinated overnight in kelp water and then sliced in cubes to be skewered.
    Before cooking it's cooked with sake and salt, then put on the grill with low heat to cook for a
    short time. A small dab of wasabi further brightens the skewer.
