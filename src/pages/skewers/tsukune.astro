  <h1>Meatball - <span>つくね</span></h1>
  <p>
    Made up of leftover trimmings from creating the other skewers, it contains white meat, dark
    meat, skin, and cartilage. The trimmings are finely ground along with green onions salt and
    pepper. We chose to form a log around the skewer, but sometimes you will see it served as round
    balls. Typically it is served with a raw egg yolk in Japan, but we forgo that and rely on the
    tare to add moisture and flavor.
