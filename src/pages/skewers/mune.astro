  <h1>Breast - <span>èƒ¸</span></h1>
  <p>
    The most boring cut of the bird and unfortunately the cut with most meat. I've tried a few
    different techniques to make the cut more interesting and have recently settled on marinating
    the breast in yuzu miso overnight. The flavor is still mild, but it compliments the clean flavor
    and soft texture of the breast.
