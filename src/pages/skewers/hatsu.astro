  <h1>Heart - <span>ハツ</span></h1>
  <p>
    Even though chicken hearts are a muscle they are fairly tender. Their fairly rich flavor goes
    well with a simple sake and salt coating. They aren't often included with the giblets of
    chickens that I buy so I likely will only have one skewer, two if I'm lucky.
