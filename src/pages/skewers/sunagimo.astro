  <h1>Gizzard - <span>砂肝</span></h1>
  <p>
    The gizzard is a muscular organ that helps chickens digest their food. It works hard along with
    some bits of grit to essentially chew the food for the chicken. The muscles work hard leading to
    a very crunchy texture, but the flavor is rather mild. I grill it simply with sake and salt and
    then squirt with a little lemon before eating. This is one of my favorite skewers to eat with a
    swig of beer.
